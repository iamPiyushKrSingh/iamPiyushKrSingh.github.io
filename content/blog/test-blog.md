# Linkedin Post

Hello everyone,
I know not many people will read this, but today, I feel like expressing myself ðŸ˜„. So, I will not waste your time by introducing myself, assuming that if you are reading this, you are following me, and if so, you must have gone through my profile (which is shit, ik).
The motive of this post is to brag about myself and what I have done last 2-3 weeks. This month starts with my father's birthday, which was very special. On that day, I had to give my end-semester biology exam, which didn't go well, but all this sadness flew away with the excitement of [NIUS (Physics)](https://nius.hbcse.tifr.res.in/) 20.1 camp.
